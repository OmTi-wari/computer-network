Aim
To use Wireshark network analyzer to capture and study packets flowing through the network and understand how different TCP/IP layers—Application, Transport, Network, and Data Link—operate and interact during communication between devices.

Theory
Wireshark is a packet-sniffing tool that allows us to see the actual data traveling across a network in real time. The TCP/IP model is divided into four layers, each responsible for a specific part of the communication process. When we capture packets in Wireshark, we can open any packet and view how each layer adds or interprets information. The Application layer contains high-level protocols such as HTTP, DNS, and FTP, showing the actual service or request being made. The Transport layer includes TCP and UDP headers that define ports, sequence numbers, acknowledgements, and reliability mechanisms. The Network layer deals with IP addressing and routing, allowing packets to travel from source to destination across networks. Finally, the Data Link layer shows MAC addresses and frame details used in local network communication. Wireshark breaks every captured packet into these protocol layers, making it easier to see how data flows, how handshakes occur, how errors are handled, and how protocols interact. By analyzing packets, we gain a clear, practical understanding of how the TCP/IP model works in real networks.
